#Arithmetic Progression
https://www.codewars.com/kata/arithmetic-progression/javascript

In your class, you have started lessons about arithmetic progression.
Since you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function that will return the first `n` elements of the sequence with the given common difference `r` and first element `a`.

The result should be a string of numbers, separated by comma and space.
Example

`arithmetic_sequence_elements(1, 2, 5) == "1, 3, 5, 7, 9"`
